# TODO-app
This is a basic TODO application where you can add a new task by clicking on the floating action button.
The tasks can be checked or unchecked accordingly.
Swiping it to the left will allow it to be deleted.
Swiping it to the right will allow it to be edited.
The same gets reflected on the screen and the database.
